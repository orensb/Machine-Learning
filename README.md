# Image Classification

 I built a convolutional neural network that can predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or from two different pairs.

 ## The Data
 - There are three main folders: train, test_w and test_m.
 - The dataset is comprised of triplets of pairs, where each such triplet of image pairs was taken in a similar setting (by the same person).
 - Every image is a numpy array of shape [224, 224, 4]
